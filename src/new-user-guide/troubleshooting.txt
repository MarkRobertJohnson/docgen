Troubleshooting
===============


Why is the PDF font size or layout different when generated on Windows vs. Linux?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DocGen does not guarantee that the PDF will be precisely identical when generated on different platforms. If this matters, choose one platform and use it consistently.

Why does Chrome PDF Viewer open or print the PDF incorrectly?
-------------------------------------------------------------

These are known issues. Only **Adobe Reader** is officially supported at this time.

Why do the links not work in the PDF?
-------------------------------------

This feature is unsupported in **wkhtmltopdf 0.9.9** but will be supported in version **0.10.0**.

Why is there an "Internet Explorer has restricted this webpage" warning?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a known issue that Internet Explorer prevents pages opened from a local folder from running scripts. The following warning may be seen:

There are two solutions:

* view the pages from any web server (simply upload them)
* disable scipts in tool-behaviours.yml by setting <code>suppress_IE_warning: true</code>. This is not recommended for production use and will also disable the code syntax highlighting in Internet Explorer.
