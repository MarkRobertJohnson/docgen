How to publish output with DocGen
=================================

Overview
--------

You publish content by running **Generator.rb**. This

- **creates a static website** (each text file in Source is converter to an HTML file in Output, e.g. content.txt becomes content.html)
- **converts the whole website into a single PDF**

Before running the Generator
----------------------------

###Update the configuration files

These are in the 'Source' folder.

- *doc-parameters.yml* sets the attributes that will appear inside the document. Most only need to entered the first time you create a new document, **but you should make sure to always update the release field when releasing a new product version**
- *tool-behaviours.yml* allows how DocGen operates to be customised (e.g. to modify the path to 'Output' folder)

> All config files (.yml) **must** be saved with UTF-8 encoding (their default format).

###Complete table-of-contents.yml

This is also in the 'Source' folder. It sets:

1. what to call each file in the HTML table of contents and which column it should appear in.
2. which order the chapters in the PDF will be.

Note that the table of contents in the PDF is based on the page headings in your text files. The only bearing that 'table-of-contents.yml' has on the PDF is to decide the order of the chapters.
You can include links to other documents or external websites in the table of contents, but they won't appear anywhere in the PDF copy.

###Update change_log.txt

If you are releasing a new version of a product, you should summarise the changes for this version and add it to the top of the page.

Run the Generator
-----------------

Use the Command Prompt on Windows or the terminal on Linux / OS X and enter (substituting the correct path):

	cd /path/to/DocGen/Generator
	ruby Generator.rb

**Advanced Usage**

DocGen looks for the 'Source' files in this order:

- the sourcePath option (e.g. run <code>ruby Generator --sourcePath "C:/Example Source/"</code> noting forward slashes and quote marks)
- the working directory (only if it contains doc-parameters.yml)
- **default**: ../Source (relative to the working directory)

The DocGen Output location can be changed in tool-behaviours.yml

Review the generated content
----------------------------
	
Open **Output/documentation.html** and check the website and PDF are as desired.

Deploy your documentation
-------------------------

The self contained website can be placed on any web server, or used locally from a computer folder.
